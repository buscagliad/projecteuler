Because of the length of this homework, I am going to make it worth 20
pts.  Also, following this e-mail, I'll send my solution to the Fraction
problem from the book (problem 8.1).  The solution will be with overloaded
operators so you can see some more examples of how to overload operators.
     

                  B  I  G  I  N  T


For this assignment, you will create a BigInt class which will allow
the representation of an arbitrarily large POSITIVE number (it becomes
a much more difficult problem to allow for SIGNED values, but if you
are interested, you are encouraged to do so).  This assignment requires
the overloading of the "+", "*", "==", "<", "^", "!" and "<<" operators.
You must write ALL manager functions - including operator=.

The operator! will compute the factorial of a BigInt, i.e.
     BigInt   five(5);
     cout << "5! = " << !five;    // should output::  5! = 120

The operator^ will behave such that x ^ n  = x * x * ... * x (n times),
i.e. x raised to the n power, e.g.
     BigInt   two(2);
     cout << "2 raise to the 4th power is "" << two ^ 4;
				// should be 16

All the other operators are as you would expect.

As a suggestion, you should have constructors for int and char* types, 
so that one could initialize a BigInt object with an integer value (providing
it is non-negative, unless you have decided on implementing the SIGNED BigInt)
or a char string like "1234123535134".  NOTE: I ran across a slight problem
with these two constructors, if you do something like:

    BigInt Zero(0);

the compiler will complain because it does not know which constructor to
call, 0 is both a valid int and a valid char* address.  So, the default
constructor should set any variable to 0.

You must develop the BigInt class, then with a driver program answer the 
following questions:

1.  FIBONACCI Sequence:  You start a rumor, such that at each second, the 
number of new people to hear the rumor is equal to the number that
learned it in the previous two seconds.

Second	Already Know     Just Heard	Total
   0         0                1           1
   1         1                1           2
   2         2                2           4
   3         4                3           7
   4         7                5          12

                etc.

Note that the "Just Heard" column forms the infamous fibonacci sequence.
Lets assume the population of the Earth is exactly 5 billion people, how
long will it take for everyone on Earth to know of this rumor?

                                                    
2.  A googol is a 1 followed by 100 zeroes, i.e., 10 raised to the power
100.  Find the number N such that

              N! < googol < (N+1)!

In this exercise, you should create the googol with the following:

    const BigInt googol = BigInt(10) ^ 100;
