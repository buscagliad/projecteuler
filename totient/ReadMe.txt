Thankyou for downloading a NumberLists number sequence!

Most common text editors should open most files we send. Your text editor may not be set to open .dat files, however it should still open.

With most of our number lists, files can become too large to open in many editors. For this reason we sometimes split files, adding in
their range to the files title - Seperated from the name of the list by a dot.

If you are having trouble opening a file, please try viewing it using Notepad++, which can be downloaded here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/

If this does not solve the problem, please contact us via the website and we wil be able to provide alternative files (perhaps splitting them up even more).

If you purchased a large quantity of numbers for your list, then you may not have the entire list in the initial download. There should be a noted estimated
delivery time in this case on the products page. If the numbers to this extent have already been generated and stored somewhere, then you should hear back
usually within a few hours. There is only so much server space available to host the downloads that sometimes lesser purchased numbers are kept offline.
Sometimes the numbers have yet to be generated. In this case your order will start a task to generate these numbers. In this case the delivery time reflects
the time it takes to regenerate the numbers. This is required when a list is too large on its own to keep stored anywhere, and is usually done when a list
is easily regenerated.

If you purchased a generating program, please see the ReadMe file specific to the generator.
