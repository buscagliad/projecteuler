/*
There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n^3 + n^2 p is a perfect cube.

For example, when p = 19, 8^3 + 8^2Ã—19 = 12^3.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
* 
* 
* For this problem, we will note that if n = a^3, and p + n is a perfect cube, i.e. p + n = x^3,
* then, 
* 	n^3 + n^2 p = n^2 ( n + p ) = a^6 ( x^3 ) = ( a^2 x )^3
* 
* So, step one is to find n (which must be a perfect cube (a^3)) such that when added to p is a 
* perfect cube.  (iscube tests for an integer being a perfect cube, and returns the cube root
* if it is).  To limit the search, we can stop whenenver (n+1)^3 - n^3 > p.
